      <p className="about-me">Hello! My name is Ada and I’m a Junior Full-Stack Software Engineer. I’m based in Los Angeles, CA. I graduated from General Assembly’s Software Engineering Immersive Program in October 2021. My passion for creating and problem-solving is what drove me to become a software engineer. During my leisure time I enjoy coding, reading, learning new languages, puzzles, spending time with my family and my cats.</p>
